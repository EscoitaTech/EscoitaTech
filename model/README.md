# üß† Acoustic Anomaly Detection Model

This folder contains all the necessary files for **local inference** on a Raspberry Pi using a **convolutional autoencoder conditioned on machine ID**. The model was trained to reconstruct acoustic spectrograms and detect anomalies by measuring the difference between the observed and expected sounds of each machine.

## üß© Model Architecture

The model is a **conditional convolutional autoencoder**, consisting of:

- An encoder that compresses 128x128x1 spectrograms together with a machine ID.
- A decoder that reconstructs the original spectrogram.
- A final embedding layer with 32 dimensions.
- A machine ID embedding block (embedding layer) with 8 dimensions.

This structure allows the model to learn machine-specific acoustic patterns, improving anomaly detection performance.

| `ids_train.npy`             | Numeric machine IDs corresponding to the training embeddings.          |

## üß™ Inference Workflow

During inference:

1. The input audio is converted into a 128x128 spectrogram.
2. The `encoder.tflite` model extracts an embedding from the spectrogram and machine ID.
3. The embedding is compared to the corresponding normal training embeddings (`emb_train.npy`) to compute a distance.
4. The distance is compared against the machine's optimal threshold (`thresholds_by_machine.pkl`) to determine whether the sound is **normal or anomalous**.
