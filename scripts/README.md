# Simulation Scripts

This folder contains the Python script `mock.py`, which simulates the operation of blower machines by generating data and states for testing the project infrastructure.

See the [detailed simulation README](mock_README.md) for instructions on how to run the script, install dependencies, and the format of the generated data.
